# Microsoft-Malware-Classification-Challenge
One of the major challenges that anti-malware faces today is the vast amounts of data and files which need to be evaluated for potential malicious intent. For example, Microsoft's real-time detection anti-malware products are present on over 160M computers worldwide and inspect over 700M computers monthly. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. One of the main reasons for these high volumes of different files is the fact that, in order to evade detection, malware authors introduce polymorphism to the malicious components. This means that malicious files belonging to the same malware "family", with the same forms of malicious behavior, are constantly modified and/or obfuscated using various tactics, such that they look like many different files.  In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of files, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their respective families. In addition, such grouping criteria may be applied to new files encountered on computers in order to detect them as malicious and of a certain family.  
For this challenge, Microsoft is providing the data science community with an unprecedented malware dataset and encouraging open-source progress on effective techniques for grouping variants of malware files into their respective families.
